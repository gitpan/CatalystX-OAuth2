    package AuthServer::Controller::OAuth2::Provider;
    use Moose;
    BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole' }

    with 'CatalystX::OAuth2::Controller::Role::Provider';

    __PACKAGE__->config(

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This action role implements the initial endpoint that triggers the
authorization grant flow. It generates an inactive authorization code
redirects to the next action in the workflow if all parameters are valid. The
authorization code is used to verify the validity of the arguments in the
subsequent request of the flow and prevent users of this library from creating
potentially unsafe front-end forms for user confirmation of the authorization.
